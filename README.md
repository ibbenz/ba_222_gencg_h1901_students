# _03-Benz_Pascal_Agent_Projects
This collection holds the final project versions created during the Generative Computing Module.
The projects were made with the intention to create a part of an entertainment system for a elevator.
The works create animated generative pictures which will enlighten the wall of the elevator

# Project 1: Mountains
Originally it was intended to create the silouette of a mountain landscape. During the process of creation 
the work transformed into a kind of stained glass windows of a church, which looks best in a spherical projection on the lift walls.
The change of idea led to a not perfectly well code. Instead of creating the whole project from scratch again, the autor decided to 
invest his energy in two other projects.

# Project 2: Pointillation
The origin idea was to create a kind of 3D-Cubes made with two squares and four edges. By the variation of the edges and squares a new shape emerged. It consists of four dots variing in diameter and orientation. An overlay of such elements colored in red, blue and green gives the appearance of a rope or even the texture of Pointillism Artwork. The latter gave this project finally its name. The project is interactive. The elevator movement will dissolve the pointillistic rope which rearanges during the movement and falls back to its original position at the end of the movement.

# Project 1: Wind
This project was created to produce a certain mood. The first approach was to create just yellow lines on a blue background which will change direction as the elevator changes direction. The movement should be smooth similar to yellow straw blown in wind. Since this approach appeared to simplistic a whole story was developed around this idea. There is a transformation from straw to stars to birds in the sky while the elevator is moving. The birds finally create a feather-like structure.
